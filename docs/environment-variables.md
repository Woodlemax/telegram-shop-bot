# Environment Variables

All configuration is done via environment variables.  
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

---

## Required

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token from @BotFather | `123456789:AAxxx...` |
| `ADMIN_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs with admin access | `123456789,987654321` |

---

## Bot

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BOT_USERNAME` | — | Bot's username without `@`. Used for referral deep-links in onboarding messages. |

---

## Admin notifications

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_GROUP_ID` | `0` _(disabled)_ | Supergroup chat ID (usually negative) for admin order notifications. When set, a single message is posted to the group instead of DMing every `ADMIN_IDS` entry. |
| `TOPIC_ORDERS_NEW` | _(empty)_ | Forum topic ID (`message_thread_id`) in `ADMIN_GROUP_ID` for new-order notifications. |
| `TOPIC_ORDERS_PAID` | _(empty)_ | Forum topic ID for paid-order notifications. |
| `TOPIC_ORDERS_DELIVERED` | _(empty)_ | Forum topic ID for delivered-order notifications. |

> Topics are optional — without them messages land in the group's General topic. Without `ADMIN_GROUP_ID` the bot keeps the old behavior: a DM to each admin.

---

## Database

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DB_PATH` | `data/shop.db` | Path to the SQLite database file. Created automatically on first run. |

---

## Redis

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REDIS_ADDR` | `localhost:6379` | Redis address. In Docker Compose this is automatically set to `redis:6379`. |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | _(empty)_ | Redis password. Leave empty if Redis has no auth. |

Redis is **optional** — when it is unreachable at startup the bot falls back to an in-memory FSM store and disables the Redis-dependent loyalty notification worker; everything else keeps working.

When available, Redis is used for:
- FSM state (add-product dialog, promo code entry, review text step)
- Caching product catalog (reduces DB reads; invalidated on payment)
- Loyalty level-up notifications (Redis Streams)

---

## Payments

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `USD_TO_STARS_RATE` | `50` | How many Telegram Stars equal $1.00. Telegram's official rate is ~50 Stars / $1. |
| `CRYPTOBOT_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | Token from [@CryptoBot](https://t.me/CryptoBot) → My Apps. Leave empty to disable crypto payments. |
| `YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID` | _(empty)_ | YooKassa merchant shop ID for RUB card payments. Must be set together with `YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY` and `YOOKASSA_RETURN_URL`; leave all three empty to disable card payments. |
| `YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY` | _(empty)_ | YooKassa secret API key. Set only together with `YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID` and `YOOKASSA_RETURN_URL`. |
| `YOOKASSA_RETURN_URL` | _(empty)_ | Public **HTTPS** page the buyer returns to after paying on the YooKassa checkout page. Set only together with the other YooKassa variables. |
| `USD_TO_RUB_RATE` | `0` | Initial RUB per USD conversion quote (example: `100`). The rate saved through `/admin` → RUB exchange rate or `/rubrate 100` overrides this default and survives restarts. Bot and Mini App share the active rate; existing orders keep their saved amounts. A positive quote is required for positive RUB prices and RUB card payments. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Stripe API secret key for USD card payments; must start with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`. Must be set together with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `STRIPE_RETURN_URL`; leave all three empty to disable USD card payments. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | Signing secret of the `<WEBHOOK_URL>/stripe-webhook` endpoint (Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks); must start with `whsec_`. Set only together with the other Stripe variables. |
| `STRIPE_RETURN_URL` | _(empty)_ | Public **HTTPS** page the buyer returns to after paying on Stripe's hosted Checkout page. Set only together with the other Stripe variables. |
| `TON_WALLET_ADDRESS` | _(empty)_ | 48-character base64url friendly address of the shop's TON wallet receiving on-chain payments. Must be set together with `USD_PER_TON`; leave both empty to disable TON payments. |
| `USD_PER_TON` | `0` | USD per 1 TON used to price TON payments, e.g. `5.25`. The USD price converts at this rate and the nanoton total is snapshotted on the order at checkout. With the default `0` (or a missing wallet address) the TON button stays hidden. |
| `TON_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Optional toncenter API key. Without one the polling worker is just rate-limited harder; an empty key is valid. |
| `NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | NOWPayments API key for hosted crypto invoices (300+ coins, priced in USD). Must be set together with `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET` and `NOWPAYMENTS_RETURN_URL`; leave all three empty to disable. |
| `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | IPN signing secret from the NOWPayments dashboard; verifies the HMAC-SHA512 `x-nowpayments-sig` header over the canonicalized IPN body. Set only together with the other NOWPayments variables. Confirm with one live test payment before enabling in production. |
| `NOWPAYMENTS_RETURN_URL` | _(empty)_ | Public **HTTPS** page the buyer returns to after paying the hosted invoice. Set only together with the other NOWPayments variables. |

---

## Webhook

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | _(empty)_ | Public HTTPS base URL; Telegram posts to `<WEBHOOK_URL>/telegram-webhook`. Leave empty to use long polling. |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | Strong secret token for webhook request verification. Required whenever `WEBHOOK_URL` is set, in every `APP_ENV`. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |

> When `WEBHOOK_URL` is empty the bot uses **long polling** — recommended for local development.

If CryptoBot is enabled, configure its callback as `<WEBHOOK_URL>/cryptobot-webhook`. If YooKassa is enabled, register `<WEBHOOK_URL>/yookassa-webhook` as the notification URL in the YooKassa merchant cabinet. If Stripe is enabled, register `<WEBHOOK_URL>/stripe-webhook` in the Stripe dashboard (Developers → Webhooks) for `checkout.session.completed` and copy its signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. If NOWPayments is enabled, register `<WEBHOOK_URL>/nowpayments-webhook` as the IPN callback URL in the NOWPayments dashboard. TON has no webhook: its polling worker settles payments by reading the watched wallet's transactions from toncenter, so TON works in long-polling deployments too.

---

## Mini App

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WEBAPP_URL` | _(empty — disabled)_ | Public **HTTPS** URL of the Mini App, e.g. `https://shop.example.com/app`. When set, the bot serves the embedded web shop at `/app/` and its REST API at `/api/*` on port 8080, and switches the bot's menu button to a `web_app` button. Leave empty to disable the Mini App entirely (the bot logs a warning and works as before). |

> Telegram only opens Web Apps over HTTPS — put the bot's port 8080 behind a TLS-terminating proxy (see the nginx example in the README).

---

## Outbound Webhooks

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OUTBOUND_WEBHOOK_URL` | _(empty)_ | Your server URL that receives HTTP POST notifications on order events. Leave empty to disable. |
| `OUTBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | Sent as `X-Webhook-Secret` header so your server can verify the request origin. |

### Payload format

```json
{
  "event": "order.paid",
  "order_id": 42,
  "user_id": 123456789,
  "total_usd": 9.99,
  "total_stars": 499,
  "method": "stars",
  "payment_id": "telegram_charge_id"
}
```

Events: `order.paid`, `order.delivered`

---

## Application

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | `development` → text logs; `production` → JSON logs + webhook secret enforced. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log verbosity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. |
| `LOCALES_DIR` | `locales` | Path to directory with translation files. Ships with 5 locales: `ru.json`, `en.json`, `es.json`, `de.json`, `zh.json`. Unknown/empty user language falls back to `en`. |

## Welcome offer and contacts

`SHOP_OFFER_URL` is an optional HTTPS link to the owner's actual published
offer, without URL credentials. `SHOP_CONTACTS_TEXT` is optional plain text
copied from the offer, at most 3000 characters. Literal `\n` becomes a newline.
Each button stays hidden while its value is blank. Do not use the repository's
generic purchase terms as the owner's offer. The contacts screen has a Back
button and requires a private chat; purchasing remains in the Mini App.

The owner's supplied Russian offer (edition 09.10.2026) is bundled at
`/app/offer.html`; its editable source is `docs/public-offer.ru.md`.
For the local shop, point SHOP_OFFER_URL at the public HTTPS address for that
page and set SHOP_CONTACTS_TEXT to its seller name, email and Telegram contact.
